int height(Position p) {
    int h{0};
    for (Position child : p.children())
        h = max(h, 1 + height(child));
    return h;
}

The running time of the above is O(n) where n represents the nodes that are Position p and its children
All entries but the root are children of another position and contribute one item of n.
