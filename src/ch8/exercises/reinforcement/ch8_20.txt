For any tree T with more than one node,
a preorder traversal cannot visit the same nodes in the same order
as a postorder traversal.

This is due to preorder always visiting the root first, thus immediately
invalidating the premise as a postorder doesn't.



However, for a tree with a single child, a preorder traversal will
visit the nodes in the reverse order of a postorder traversal.
