A proper binary tree is a tree where all nodes have either 0 or 2 children
Because the number of nodes is 2d + 1 (the root), a proper binary tree will always have an odd number of nodes.

Thus if improper tree T has an even number of nodes (2s), there must always be one additional node added to make it balanced.

At this point, for any two positions with one child, move one child to the other position so that it now has two children.

Thus, with the addition of one additional node, an improper tree of size n can become a proper binary tree of size n + 1.
