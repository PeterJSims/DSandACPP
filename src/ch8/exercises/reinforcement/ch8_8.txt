 As height is really the maximum number of edges, this tree represents a level 1 height of a proper
 binary tree. As is evident, the number of external nodes is one greater than the height, or h + 1.

 A second example of a proper binary tree with the minimum number of external nodes. In this case,
 for a binary tree of height 2, the minimum number of external nodes is n + 1 or 2 + 1 = 3.

 In this complete binary tree, the maximum amount of external nodes is 2 raised to the power of the tree height of 2.
 2^2 = 4, so the maximum number of external nodes in a proper binary tree is 2^h


 c) log(n + 1) - 1 <= h <= (n-1)/2 for a proper binary tree of h height and n nodes

    1a. The figure in answer a represents the minimum binary tree with a height > 0.

        log(3 + 1) - 1 where 3 is the number of nodes
        log(4) - 1
        = 2 - 1
        = 1
        1 = height 1

    1b. Figure C represents the minimum number of nodes in a tree of height 2 where n = 5
        log(5 + 1) - 1 <= 2
        log(6) - 1 <= 2
        2 - 1 <= 2
        1 < 2

        Thus it is shown that the lower bound of the height is equal to or greater than log(n + 1) - 1
        where n is the number of nodes in the proper binary tree.


   2a. The figure in answer b represents the maximum nodes in a proper binary tree of height 2.
        (n - 1) / 2
         = (7 - 1) / 2
         = 3
        h = 2
        2 < 3 thus it is shown that the height less than (n - 1)/ 2
    2b. Figure C represents the minimum number of nodes in a tree of height 2 where n = 2
        (n - 1) / 2
        = (5 - 1) / 2
        = 2
        2 = height 2

        Thus it is shown that the upper bound of the height is equal to or less than (n - 1)/ 2
        where n is the number of nodes in the proper binary tree.


 d) For n = 3, h = 1 the upper bound and lower bound are attained with equality
