Outclassed by ex 52! Doing this one instead


An evil king has n bottles of wine, and a spy has just poisoned one of them.
Unfortunately, they do not know which one it is. The poison is very deadly;
just one drop diluted even a billion to one will still kill. Even so,
it takes a full month for the poison to take effect. Design a scheme for
determining exactly which one of the wine bottles was poisoned in just (log n)
one month's time while expending
taste testers.



1) Convert the bottles to binary digits
1 = 001
2 = 010
3 = 100
4 = 101
etc

Assign one drinker per bit position and have them drink.
Go through each number from 1 to n, and if it has a 1 in the drinker's bit position,
they have a drop from the bottle.
After one month, line them up again and the dead ones will reveal which
flipped bits represented poison.

At n >= 8 this represents log n taste testers and n operations
